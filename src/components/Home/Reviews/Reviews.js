                            Everything is good except that the room was hot if the room maybe a little cooler. using the ac didn't help.

                            Stayed in the King suite, which was a large room with sofa bed. Comfortable bed and pillows, and a nice basket breakfast every day. While some complained about the train, if the fan on the A/C unit is on, you really donâ€™t hear it.Only concern is if you leave the windows open, anyone could pretty much get in. Small alleyway means cars drive very close to the window - you feel like a drive-thru. But great staff and good location.

                            So impressed with our stay at Basecamp. We had a large, 10-person suite at the Resort... it was roomy, fully stocked, beautifully furnished, and had the easiest check-in and check-out. For anyone with a large group (family, group of friend, etc.) I can't recommend this enough. And the rooftop hot tub has the best views!

                            Great location, clean room and I really appreciated the quality bathroom products (Rocky Mountain House shampoo, soap, etc). Nothing really to improve on.

                            We stayed in a 3 bedroom condo and were a party of 7. Lots of room, high standards of amenities, clean, quiet and amazing location. I will definitely stay again whenever we are in Canmore and have recommended to friends!
